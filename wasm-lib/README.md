Intended for use with [cyberdeck](https://crates.io/crates/cyberdeck) by richardanaya. I found it useful for a project, but didn't like having to include JS code to create the WebRTC connection/channels. 

See https://github.com/gsteinLTU/cyberdeck/blob/master/examples/wasm/src/lib.rs for an example program using this.
